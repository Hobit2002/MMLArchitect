Github does not alow me to store files bigger than 100MB and the whole repository has to be smaller than 1GB. Big data do not have their name just for fun, so instead of publishing datasets with which I actually work, I publish only much smaller files that should, however, give some idea to an occassional visitor, how does my work look like.
